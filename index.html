                    <!--Write a professional paragraph about yourself-->
                    <p>My name is Michael Wolf Rosenstraus, and I am a fifteen-year-old residing in Marlboro, New Jersey. As someone who was born on October 12th, 2007, I have grown to appreciate the beauty of life and all that it has to offer. Living with my loving parents, three cats, and a dog, I am grateful for the sense of family and companionship that surrounds me.

However, amidst all the blessings in my life, my greatest confidant and source of inspiration is my grandmother, who has been my best friend since birth. She has been my best friend since I was a child, and her unwavering support and wisdom have been invaluable to me. In her presence, I find solace and comfort, and I am constantly reminded of the importance of cherishing our relationships and experiences.

As I navigate through my teenage years, I aspire to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way. I am passionate about learning and exploring new fields of knowledge, and I am determined to make a positive impact in the world. Whether it be through my academic pursuits, my creative ventures, or my interpersonal relationships, I am committed to living a life of purpose and fulfillment.

In essence, I am a young man with a vision and a drive to excel. With the support of my loved ones and my own determination, I know that I can achieve greatness and make a difference in the world around me.</p>
